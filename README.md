# Todo List Application

This project helps you to manage tasks on a todo list. You can view all of the tasks you still have to do, add additional items to the todo list, edit an already existing task, and delete tasks when you complete them.

## Technologies used:

I used the technologies of the "PERN" stack. These are PostgreSQL, ExpressJS, NodeJS, and ReactJS.

## How to Run This Project

Make sure to have Node.js, npm, and PostgreSQL installed.

Open up PostgreSQL and enter the two commands from the database.sql file.

Now, navigate to the terminal and cd into the project directory.

Run the following commands:

```cd backend```
```npm install```
```npm start```
Now, open a new terminal window and cd into the project directory.

Run the following commands:

```cd client```
```npm install```
```npm start```
The project should open in your browser, and be ready for use.

The todo list data will be stored, even when you close the application and rerun it.

To exit this application go to both of the terminal windows that are still running and press "Ctrl + C".
